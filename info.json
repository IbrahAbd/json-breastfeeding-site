      "bio": "I am a mother to 4 children (ages 9, 13, 17, 21). I am a medical doctor with an interest in paediatric primary care and lactation. I run a private practice in Parow, Cape Town. I am also an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant and I volunteer my time with La Leche League South Africa. In that capacity I run free breastfeeding support meetings and whats app groups for mothers. I also serve as the Professional Liaison Leader for LLLSA and am part of a group on the Medical Advisory team for LLL International. As a doctor I was dismayed to find out how little I knew about breastfeeding until I joined LLLSA. It's sadly a neglected area of medical training."

I desperately wanted to learn the 'truth' about breastfeeding. I did a Peer Counselling course and went on to become a La Leche League Leader in 1998, offering breastfeeding help and support. I coordinated a Breastfeeding Peer Counselor project for 16 years, and currently continue to support mothers."
